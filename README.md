Here's how it works:

- Open up Terminal / your CLI
- Make sure to download the appropriate node modules according to the package.json file
- Type `node bamazonCustomer.js` and hit Enter
- Follow the prompts
- Have fun!

The game uses basic concepts in node packages, modules, mysql and dotenv, so is good for a first run at mysql via node!
